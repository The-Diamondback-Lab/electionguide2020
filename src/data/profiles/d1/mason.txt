    <p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Although she was eventually reinstated, it wasn&rsquo;t long before President Donald
        Trump announced a ban on transgender service members. </span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c1">For Mason, hearing the president&rsquo;s words set something off inside her.</span>

    <p class="c9"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If this is going to happen to tens of thousands of people by a tweet ... I
        wasn&rsquo;t going to stand up and let this happen anymore. I was going to stand up and fight this the best way

    <p class="c9"><span class="c1">Mason is running to become the U.S. Representative for Maryland&rsquo;s 1st
        Congressional District. If elected, the 20-year Navy, Army and National Guard veteran would become

    <ul class="c17 lst-kix_w3rf3mqd1pqk-0 start">
      <li class="c3"><span class="c1">Mason supports the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and opposes all offshore drilling
          projects, including the Delmarva Pipeline, a proposed natural gas line that would run along the Eastern Shore.
          She advocates for clean energy reforms. </span></li>

    <ul class="c17 lst-kix_svqwmnmn55xx-0 start">
      <li class="c3"><span class="c1">Mason&rsquo;s website describes her as a strong union ally. She believes improved
          transportation routes will help more Marylanders access jobs and that manufacturing incentives will bring new
          opportunities to the Eastern Shore. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c17 lst-kix_h3wonkt592dt-0 start">

    <ul class="c17 lst-kix_uyg1wu27yurq-0 start">
      <li class="c3"><span>Mason acknowledges systemic racism. In a recent interview, she called for more widespread
          diversity education training and for the removal of the &ldquo;Talbot Boys&rdquo; memorial from the Talbot
          County Courthouse, which recognizes Confederate soldiers. </span></li>
