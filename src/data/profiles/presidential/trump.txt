<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Incumbents are often the center of presidential elections&nbsp;&mdash; but the
    attention President Donald Trump has drawn in the months preceding November&rsquo;s election has been
    historical. </span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Over the past month, a New York Times investigation into the president&rsquo;s
    federal income tax returns revealed his failing businesses and gargantuan debt. He tested positive for COVID-19,
    the virus he&rsquo;s downplayed for months, and his performance at the first presidential debate prompted the
    nonpartisan debate commission to mute candidates&rsquo; microphones at times during the final debate.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Rather than an agenda for a second term, the president&rsquo;s campaign website
    includes a list of promises he believes he&rsquo;s kept. Here are the pillars of the president&rsquo;s
    reelection campaign:</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_atj86jd2bdzp-0 start">
  <li class="c0"><span>Trump has advertised himself as the candidate best suited to fix the American economy, which
      has tanked since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">He continues to advocate for hardline trade policies on China and rallied support
      by stating that he&rsquo;ll bring manufacturing jobs back to America&rsquo;s working towns.</span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Throughout his term, Trump has sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which
      former President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. With law set to come before the Supreme Court one week
      after the election, the president&rsquo;s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett may have been a step towards
      repeal. Barrett declined to offer her stance on the law during her confirmation hearings.</span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Since 2016, Trump has rolled back a number of Obama-era regulations and pulled the
      U.S. from the Paris Agreement.</span></li>
</ul>
