<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Jo Jorgensen, a senior lecturer at Clemson University, is the Libertarian
    party&rsquo;s candidate. </span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Libertarian party, the nation&rsquo;s third largest political party, centers
    around promoting individual liberty from what followers believe is an overreaching government.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Jorgensen&rsquo;s campaign promises include the following, according to her campaign
    website:</span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_107cimzmdgl-0 start">
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Rid the Food and Drug Administration of its efficacy requirements or abolish the
      agency entirely. She delivered harsh criticism of the government&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic and claimed
      bureaucracy and regulation prevented Americans from getting the help they needed. </span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Address America&rsquo;s mass incarcerations by ending the country&rsquo;s war on
      drugs, an effort that she said has caused a drug &ldquo;prohibition problem.&rdquo;</span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">End federal government licensing requirements for workers and push states to do
      the same.</span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Replace coal and oil power plants with nuclear power plants.</span></li>
</ul>
