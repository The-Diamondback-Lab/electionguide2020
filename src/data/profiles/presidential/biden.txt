    and insisting he will restore dignity to the Oval Office.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>

      $400,000.</span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Enact criminal justice reform in the wake of the country&rsquo;s revamped racial

      said led to mass incarceration disproportionately affecting Black people. </span></li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Rejoin the Paris Agreement and invest in clean energy technology. He has said
      repeatedly that he does not support the Green New Deal, though he endorses it on his campaign website.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0"><span class="c1">Restore relations with international allies that critics have said Trump has
      hindered.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Biden has not indicated whether he would support raising the number of Supreme Court
    justices should Barrett be confirmed Monday as expected.</span></p>
