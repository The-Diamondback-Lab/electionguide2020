<p class="c9"><span class="c1">There are few in Congress who have been around as long as Rep. Steny Hoyer. The
    University of Maryland alumnus entered politics in 1966 after winning a seat in the Maryland Senate. He became
    the senate&#x2019;s youngest-ever president nine years later before being elected to Congress in 1981. He is now
    serving his 20th term. </span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>This is Hoyer&#x2019;s second time as House Majority leader, a role he first assumed from
    2007-2011. </span><span class="c6">Though Hoyer has had many victories throughout his long legislative career
    &#x2014; including</span><span>&#xA0;co-sponsor</span><span class="c6">ing</span><span>&#xA0;the 2000 Chesapeake
    Bay Restoration Act </span><span class="c6">and </span><span>help</span><span class="c6">ing</span><span>&#xA0;pass the Americans with Disabilities </span><span class="c6">Act &#x2014; in
    recent years, he&apos;s</span><span>&#xA0;been criticized for his desire to limit spending on Medicare, Medicaid
    and Social Security, </span><span class="c6">among other things</span><span class="c1">. Many see the
    long-serving, 81-year-old Hoyer as out of touch with his younger constituents. </span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>Though </span><span class="c6">Hoyer </span><span>faced a serious primary challenger earlier
    this year in progressive candidate Mckayla Wilkes (with a coalition of Maryland students behind her),
  </span><span class="c6">he </span><span>ultimately defeated Wilkes with a </span><span class="c4 c19"><a class="c2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/02/us/elections/results-maryland-house-district-5-primary-election.html">sizable
      majority</a></span><span>&#xA0;of the Democratic vote.</span><span class="c23">&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c1">Here&#x2019;s where he stands on the issues:</span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_j5srh1x57825-0 start">
  <li class="c3"><span>Earlier this month, Hoyer and Sen. Ben Cardin announced legislation to designate Southern
      Maryland as a National Heritage Area, a move that could bring more federal support to local conservation
      efforts. In September, Hoyer and other Maryland politicians also announced more than $3 million in federal
      spending for Chesapeake Bay restoration projects. In the past, he&#x2019;s advocated for legislation to reduce
      carbon emissions. However, Hoyer has come under fire in recent years for his and other Democratic
      leaders&#x2019; decision to </span><span class="c4 c19"><a class="c2" href="https://readsludge.com/2019/02/21/dems-not-backing-green-new-deal-took-far-more-money-from-oil-and-gas-interests/">withhold
        legislative and subpoena power</a></span><span>&#xA0;from the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis,
      borne out of the Green New Deal movement. Hoyer takes campaign contributions from oil and gas companies and
      has </span><span class="c4 c19"><a class="c2" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-increasingly-backing-oil-and-gas-industry-1407790617">supported
        legislation aiding these industries</a></span><span class="c1">&#xA0;in the past. &#xA0;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_j5srh1x57825-0">
  <li class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoyer has supported major legislation in recent months meant to alleviate the
      economic effects of the pandemic and provide aid to frontline workers, including the Cares Act and the Heroes
      Act (which is still being negotiated). Hoyer is vocal in his criticism toward President Trump and Republican
      leaders over their handling of the pandemic. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c8 c16"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_j5srh1x57825-0">
  <li class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoyer voted in support of the Justice in Policing Act this summer, which advocates
      for police reforms such as a ban on no-knock warrants and a national database on police misconduct. He also
      introduced legislation to remove Confederate statues and other reminders of slavery and segregation from the
      U.S. Capitol. Hoyer does not support defunding the police. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<ul class="c17 lst-kix_j5srh1x57825-0">
  <li class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoyer has been vocal about helping constituents secure unemployment benefits and
      housing assistance as the coronavirus pandemic trudges on. He has also been supportive of emergency aid for
      small businesses through the Cares Act. Following the 2008 recession, Hoyer helped launch the &#x201C;Make It
      In America&#x201D; legislative agenda, originally focused on boosting American manufacturing. The agenda has
      since been altered to focus on entrepreneurship and infrastructure. </span></li>
