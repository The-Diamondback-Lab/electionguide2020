<p>George McDermott’s <a href="http://www.georgemcdermott.com/youdontknow.html">campaign website</a> is devoted to uncovering “judicial terrorism.”</p>

<p>In his words, government officials are not being held accountable to the Constitution. He describes himself as a victim’s rights advocate for victims of white collar crime and “judicial abuse” in particular. McDermott writes that he was <a href="https://redmaryland.com/2020/01/red-maryland-candidate-survey-george-mcdermott-for-congress-district-4/">inspired to study law after losing his businesses</a> in a court battle in the 1980s.</p>

<p>his will be McDermott’s third time running against Rep. Anthony Brown for U.S. Representative for Maryland’s 4th Congressional District — he lost by a margin of more than 50 percentage points in both previous races.</p>

<p>McDermott has said he never has and never will endorse President Donald Trump, according to The Capital Gazette.</p>

<p>Here’s where he stands on the issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>McDermott believes income inequality is a salient issue in the U.S. He disapproves of Trump’s 2017 federal tax cuts.</li>
<li>McDermott supports a federal face-covering mandate. He believes more funding should go toward private citizens and state and local governments in Congress’s next economic relief package.</li>
<li>McDermott has said he supports legislation calling for greater transparency from law enforcement and more accountability from police officers.</li>
<li>McDermott is wary of an impending climate crisis in the U.S. and said he views the actions proposed in the Green New Deal as a start in dealing with this issue. He has indicated support for eliminating fossil fuel dependency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
</ul>
